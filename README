XRF Firmware Uploader 1.0 - a tool to upload new firmware on XRF  
                            modules from Ciseco (www.ciseco.co.uk)

Copyright (C) 2012  Marc Eberhard (eberhardma@googlemail.com)
Tweaked by Matt Lloyd <dps.lwk at gmail.com> to work on OSX

This was originally written by Marc to update his XRF on linux
We (Ciseco) made some minor tweaks to get it to compile on OSX

To compile on R-Pi/linux
$ g++ xrf_uploader.cpp -o xrf_uploader
$ chmod +x xrf_uploader

To run 
$ ./xrf_uploader -d /dev/tty**** -f *****.bin


Current Uploader Limits: 
v1.0 of the uploader is only compatibly with v1.5 XRF's that are all-ready running Boot-loader v3 or above.
The uploader cannot update the Boot-loader.
